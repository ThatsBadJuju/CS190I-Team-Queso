This is our HW3 Submission for CS190I - Team Queso.

We're building a lifeguard simulator to help lifeguards-in-training improve their awareness skills for distressed or drowning swimmers. Currently, we have an outdoor pool scene, with a tower, board, and common pool objects â€” we will add more if needed in our scenes.

We also have an example person in the pool, which we will animate to make them float in the water. The plan is to have multiple people in the pool at once, and have the lifeguard detect if any of them are drowning.

Finally, we are planning on a second form of locomotion, which is swimming, but it may be difficult to make our swimming motions look realistic in VR without being dizzying for the user.
